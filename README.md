ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stuart Houston

Senior-level Data Scientist | MLOps & AI Infrastructure

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist focused on building production-ready, modular ML pipelines that demonstrate value quickly while laying the foundations for scalable, secure deployment.

As the sole Data Scientist at CNOOC International, my work involves more than just model development itâ€™s about proving whatâ€™s possible, showing where Data Science creates value, and designing workflows that can evolve smoothly from proof-of-concept to production once the infrastructure is ready.

Much of my work uses controlled-access industrial data governed by internal standards, so the public repositories here serve as case studies that reflect similar challenges: messy, real-world data, feasibility testing, and designing systems that are robust enough to scale.
