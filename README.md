ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stuart Houston  
Iâ€™m a Data Scientist focused on delivering proofâ€‘ofâ€‘concepts that demonstrate value quickly while laying the foundations for scalable, productionâ€‘ready solutions.

As the sole Data Scientist at CNOOC, my role goes beyond building models itâ€™s about proving whatâ€™s possible, showing the business where Data Science adds value, and designing solutions with the modularity and reproducibility needed to migrate from development to production infrastructure when the organisation is ready.

Because much of my work involves sensitive data, I can only share selected public projects here. These repos are curated as case studies that reflect the same challenges I tackle professionally: messy industrial data, feasibility testing, and building pipelines robust enough to scale.
