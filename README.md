# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stuart Houston

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist specialising in building **endâ€‘toâ€‘end ML and LLM solutions** in regulated industries.  
Currently the sole Data Scientist at CNOOC, I focus on **capabilityâ€‘building, MLOps practices, and strategic AI adoption** in environments where production infrastructure is still maturing.

Because much of my work involves confidential data, I can only share selected public projects here. These repos are designed as **case studies** that reflect the same challenges I tackle professionally: messy industrial data, complianceâ€‘heavy contexts, and the need for reproducible, productionâ€‘minded pipelines.

## ðŸ§­ What I Focus On
- Designing **productionâ€‘ready pipelines** even in infraâ€‘limited environments  
- Embedding **MLOps practices**: reproducibility, testing, CI/CD, experiment tracking  
- Translating technical work into **businessâ€‘aligned outcomes** (compliance, risk, asset management)  
- Building **AI capability from scratch**: policies, governance, and roadmaps
