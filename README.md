## ðŸ”­ Current Focus
- **Predictive Maintenance & Anomaly Detection** on industrial datasets.  
- **P&ID Digitisation**: Automating diagram parsing with object detection, OCR, and structured outputs.  
- **ML Engineering & MLOps**: Building production-ready ML pipelines, dashboards, and internal Python tooling.
